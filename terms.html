      <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6 text-[var(--color-gold)]">Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
      <p class="mb-6 text-lg">These Terms &amp; Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the services provided by GAEVENTS Productions LLC ("GAEVENTS", "we", or "us"). By engaging our services or accessing our website, you agree to be bound by these Terms. Please read them carefully.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-[var(--color-gold)]">1. Scope of Services</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">GAEVENTS provides event production, logistics, technical and related consulting services as described in proposals and service agreements. We will deliver services with reasonable skill and care in accordance with industry standards and the specifications agreed with you ("Client").</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-[var(--color-gold)]">2. Proposals and Fees</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">All proposals or quotations are valid for 30 days unless otherwise stated. Our fees are based on the scope of work, event requirements and timelines. Prices may be subject to taxes, permits, licenses and third‑party charges.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-[var(--color-gold)]">3. Payments</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">A non‑refundable deposit (typically 25% of the total estimated cost) is required upon acceptance of our proposal. The remaining balance is due prior to the event date unless otherwise specified in your service agreement. Additional costs incurred due to changes requested by the Client or unforeseen circumstances will be invoiced separately and are payable upon receipt.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-[var(--color-gold)]">4. Changes, Rescheduling and Cancellations</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Any changes to the agreed scope, timeline or requirements must be communicated in writing and may result in additional charges. We will make reasonable efforts to accommodate rescheduling requests subject to availability and third‑party obligations.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">If you cancel the event after booking, the following refund policy will apply:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>Cancellations 30 days or more before the event: a full refund of fees paid (excluding the non‑refundable deposit).</li>
        <li>Cancellations between 15 and 29 days before the event: a 50% refund of fees paid (excluding the non‑refundable deposit).</li>
        <li>Cancellations within 14 days of the event: no refund will be issued.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">These policies help reduce last‑minute cancellations and potential chargebacks, as recommended by industry best practices【892447413900311†L15-L37】【892447413900311†L52-L55】.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">If GAEVENTS is forced to cancel due to unforeseen circumstances, we will provide a full refund of amounts paid and use reasonable efforts to reschedule the event. We shall not be liable for any consequential losses.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-[var(--color-gold)]">5. Client Responsibilities</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">The Client agrees to provide timely access to venues, information and materials necessary for event planning and execution. The Client is responsible for obtaining any required permits, approvals or insurance not expressly included in our proposal and for ensuring all activities comply with applicable laws and venue regulations.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-[var(--color-gold)]">6. Third‑Party Vendors</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">GAEVENTS may recommend or engage third‑party vendors on your behalf. While we will select reputable vendors, we do not guarantee their performance and shall not be responsible for the acts or omissions of third parties. You will be responsible for any contracts with vendors unless otherwise stated.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-[var(--color-gold)]">7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">To the maximum extent permitted by law, GAEVENTS shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential or punitive damages arising from your use of our services. In any case, GAEVENTS's total liability shall not exceed the amounts paid by you for the services giving rise to the claim.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-[var(--color-gold)]">8. Force Majeure</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">We shall not be liable for failure to perform our obligations due to causes beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, pandemics, labour disputes, civil disturbances, or governmental orders. In such cases, we will work with you to reschedule the event or provide an appropriate solution.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-[var(--color-gold)]">9. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">All materials, designs, plans, concepts and content created by GAEVENTS remain our intellectual property unless otherwise agreed in writing. You are granted a non‑exclusive, non‑transferable right to use such materials solely for the purposes of your event.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-[var(--color-gold)]">10. Confidentiality</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Both parties agree to keep confidential any proprietary or sensitive information disclosed during the engagement, except as required to perform the services or as required by law.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-[var(--color-gold)]">11. Governing Law</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, United States, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Georgia.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-[var(--color-gold)]">12. Miscellaneous</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not be deemed a waiver.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">We reserve the right to update or modify these Terms at any time. The most current version will be posted on our website. Your continued use of our services after any changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
